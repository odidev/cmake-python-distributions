Welcome to CMake Python Distributions's documentation!
======================================================

I am working on a generatting aarch64 cmake wheel
This project is where I am testing the things
You must not use this project to grab numpy features
I am expecting it to go away at some point in the future
Please visit official cmake pypi page: `https://pypi.org/project/cmake/`_ to install cmake
